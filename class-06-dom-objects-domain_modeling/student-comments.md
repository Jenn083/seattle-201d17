## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Honestly, nothing really. I think the structure is great, and learning new concepts everyday is fun (and hard).

- From Code Fellows part: none From my part: I need to re-do my lectures so I have a better understanding of the topic

- I thought that the concepts covered were things I thought based on descriptions of the course, the amount of prep work and the test to get in, that there would be a higher baseline.

- Needing to log aha moments in the book reading assignments

- I found everything was helpful, even things that I was reviewing for the first time.

- The majority of this week was a refresher for me. Most of these concepts I already have experience with. Still great to go through it.


- I thought I learned a lot of Git Hub properties and such but almost all of the CSS HTML and JS this week I had learned through prepwork.

- I thought that while being inquisitive is good there were a lot of questions asked by students that were not pertinent and were because they weren't paying attention. While this is hard for the instructor to control I think that when we get into more advanced problems the needless questions may take up our very valuable class time and the instructor needs to be more on top of answering nonsense questions without wasting large periods of time.

- learning journals, Ted video

- reading.

- I would say that the least helpful aspects were the fact that the TA to student ratio is a bit off, so I found it rather difficult to get help sometimes.

- I found most the canvas assignments to be a waste of time that we could have been doing more coding. Also the lecture portions of the day seem like they would be more useful if : a) there was some program that the students followed along on writing actual code as the teacher explains each step and why its happening. or b) The lectures time was drastically shortened and there was more time to actually code . I feel like there is a lot of wasted time on both the reading and the lecture that could be used actually getting our hands dirty with some code tutorial or games prior to our lab assignments.

- There hasn't been any part of the curriculum or lecture that hasn't taught me something new. I do fear the amount of people in the class will slow things down though.

- There was a lot of information covered this week, and I thought most of it was relevant and helpful.

- I was ready for the course to be more challenging, right away. The instructor in the 101 course implied 201 would be very hard. Yet the biggest problems I had were definitely with finicky problems with Atom, Canvas and GitHub, not the actual curriculum.

- The pace during the class time portion is way too slow. I'm certainly learning things, but the ratio of time to things learned is painful.

- I thought the first day and a half for introduction was too long. We should have started learning/lecturing/coding right away.

- It's hard to pay attention when every 5- 10 minutes the instructor is switching from displaying code to wanting to use his ipad, and things are not set up for seamless transitions. It wastes too much time.

- Running so late with lecture- by the time he goes over the most important information of the day I'm hungry and tired- and by the time I finally eat and start lab- I don't feel confident about starting. I wish he were MORE disciplined on time. That or I could give him the migraine I had this past Friday from him not ending lecture until 1 pm.

- I found all aspects helpful

- I'd say I learned the least on HTML even though 1/3 of the class time is spent on it. I'd like to spend more time learning JavaScript. I know this might be a personal preference but I feel that JavaScript is a lot more complex.

- The lectures, while informative, may be better with more hands on work involved with them instead of just the passive act of paying attention.

- For the first week everything was helpful in my mind.

- Git instructions... I'm wondering if they couldn't be placed in a cheat sheet with diagrams or is the intent to let the students struggle to learn?


## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- I think lecture is helpful in itself. I do like starting the day with code review from the previous day. I also think going over lab prep in good detail is nice. I make sure to take detailed notes to reference when in lab. Lab time is super cool and collaborative. Pair programming is awesome.

- The approach to teaching/learning, this was new to me but I feel it is making me improve in how I am learning the material compared to how I used to approach the process of learning.

- stacked modules

- I love the structure, with the critique / code review in the morning, the lecture and then the lab.

- The most helpful areas for me was the 960 grid style in CSS and the use of Git.

- I thought the instructor did a great job of explaining everything and really went into detail on all the topics. I imagine this will be the most important thing for me going forward.

- deliberate practice of git process, code reviews, code partner

- lab and hands on practice.

- To me the most helpful aspects were the pre-lab breakdowns. I found that most of the answers to the lab problems required some sneaky little thing that was difficult to suss out, but the preparation was nice, anyway.

- Lab time by far is the most helpful. Especially the partner labs because you both learn from each other since both parties have different skill sets and methods of doing things.

- The lab time. The lecture is important, definitely, and I value that, but I'm surprised by how important it is to just be working in that environment, whether independently or not.

- Working in Github this week was helped me feel more comfortable with using the terminal and understanding the version control process. Kevin, Kevia, and Aliza provided a lot of support in lab, especially with asking questions to help me break down a problem.

- I thought the code reviews were informative. I wish there was more opportunity for code reviews, whether by a TA or a teacher, as that was my main driver to joining a boot camp was to learn code and get timely feedback on it.

- The labs, especially working with other students.

- I found lab work to be the most helpful. I enjoyed pair-programming and just working with code in general. Lecture is way too long, in my opinion. I would rather have 2-2.5 hour lecture and 5.5-6 hour lab.

- Being able to dedicate my day to learning about code. I'm honestly so angry at the instructor for bad time management right now- it's blocking out any other positive feelings I had towards this course.

- the most helpful aspect would be lab

- I think the code review a the beginning of the class is most helpful. Not only it gives students the opportunity to see how many ways to approach solving a problem but also allow us to ask questions and explore our own approach.

- The lab time where you can collaborate with all of the other fellow aspiring coders while having the support of the TAs and instructor as well.

- Code reviews and lab are awesome. Plus, what really helped me to find out how to code was the way Sam showed pseudo coding on the board. Which was really helpful in knowing how to talk to computer logically.

- the teachers and assistants.

## DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- No, everything is great. :)

- Very happy I decided to attend Code Fellows.

- I thought that the opening address to all the students on the first day could be improved. Some of the language that the speaker used I think could be upgraded. For example, I don't think saying that there are "no tears allowed" and that students need to "put on their big girl and big boy underpants" emphasizes or represents the type of supportive learning community that I've experienced at Code Fellows. I also think that we should be more aware of diversity and that their should be a gender neutral bathroom in the building.

- More directed practice. If we can follow along during lecture it keeps us involved and gives up repetition.

- I have no pressing concerns at present.

- Not that I haven't already expressed.

- Yes, but I have a feeling it will only be a thing in 201 and that 301 will be much different. If not, I'll let you know.

- A few of my questions regarding, LinkedIn specialist help and making your personal portfolio stronger have been met with "oh we get to that in 401." Which makes it seems like I am being up-sold and makes me have doubts of the value of 201.

- A chin up bar nearby would be nice!

- I would like to have cheatsheets handouts, such as: keyboard shortcuts, git/github workflow, and terminal commands.

- More instructor suggestions: He needs a slide system for his lectures. He also needs to map out EXACTLY how much time he is going to spend talking about each topic. On Friday he spent an hour on CSS. A lot of it was blabbing about how it just takes practice and look at this and this tutorial. It would've been better for him to lead a short demo and then send out links. For a teacher with his experience to keep running overboard, shows a lack of planning on the execution of his topics. He needs to delegate some work to his TA's- i.e. class video uploads, and setting up the classroom, making sure the stylus for his ipad is charged.

- Yes, provide Github cheat sheets. The learning process of the commands and the steps would be so much easier to understand with documented instructions.
