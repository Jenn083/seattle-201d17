# Class 7: Object-Oriented Programming with Constructor Functions; HTML Tables

<a id="top"></a>
# Today's Plan: Week 2, Tuesday Lecture

#### Quiz 4 will be published this afternoon and will be due tomorrow (Wednesday) night.

- Announcements
  - Sam has two hour-long meetings this afternoon: one at noon and one at 4:00. Note that after the noon meeting Sam will also need a little break time in which to throw down some lunch.
  - We're through the first third of the toughest part of the week. Keep plugging away!
  - Keep an eye on Wednesday night weather: there is potential for another snow event that could affect the Thursday AM commute.

- [Lab overview](#lab)

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 7 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate an object literal into a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to use the ‘prototype’ property to extend the inheritable properties and methods of a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to dynamically build an HTML table with JavaScript and render it to the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment

## Code Review

Rather than go through someone's code this morning, we'll start today with Sam just building out a solution to yesterday. You'll get a lot of insight into process and also into some of the details.

## Constructor Functions

We'll look at how to build constructor functions from object literals and talk about some large-scale design issues relating to this week's project.
